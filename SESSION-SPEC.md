# Wireframe — current state

## Goal and authority

Build a complete, usable offline Rust wireframing product for macOS, Windows and Linux, with close visual and behavioral fidelity to the established specification. The overall goal remains active. The initial investigation/readiness gate was met on 2026-10-13, and the user authorized automatic implementation progression. Continue targeted investigation when fidelity questions arise; do not treat a partial control inventory or passing foundation tests as product completion.

Work directly as Engineer. Preserve user files and explicit deferrals. Use synthetic fixtures for native experiments. Keep reference-specific names, extracted implementation/assets and investigation narratives outside this repository and its Git history. Original code is GPL-3.0-only from first commit 87f11c1; preserve dependency notices. Existing-format import remains deferred.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-16, phone artwork refinement accepted

Notched Phone frames now use refined screen openings and style-specific contour weights, positioned side switches and capsule speaker/camera details. Clean side switches are outlined; Sketch switches are solid. Layout, intrinsic dimensions, visibility gates, status, clipping, transparency and the other models remain intact. See docs/PHONE-LAYOUT.md.

All twelve design comparisons improve. Eight additional portrait/landscape Fit/Stretch cases at a new size were visually checked after fixing the artwork parameters. Other phone-model pixels and all Tablet gallery files remain unchanged. Across twenty realistic scenario/options images, sixteen are unchanged and four change only inside Notched Phone controls. All six source documents are byte-identical. Four PDF pages were visually inspected and retain searchable text. Local component overrides, history and storage checks pass.

All 602 tests across 133 targets pass in one complete run. Clippy, formatting, signed packaging, source boundary, first-commit GPL and unchanged dependencies/fonts pass. Native width edit/Undo/Redo, transparency/Undo, style/Undo and process restart/reopen restore exact project bytes; the native Clean PNG matches the generated export. The running macOS app shows the mutable Sketch phone fixture at 59% Fit, 8 controls, 0 selected, Saved. Self-review only; native Windows/Linux remains unverified.

Exact device curvature/antialiasing and status glyphs remain open. Tablet artwork needs a separate investigation before changes. Preserve accepted outline and canvas text corrections. Explicit fixed Text Input heights, broader typography, held library-drag cadence, failure/performance and native Windows/Linux acceptance remain unresolved. The overall goal remains active.

## Existing capabilities and limits

The 86-entry catalog, typed inspector, shared canvas/PNG/SVG rendering, recursive groups/components, rich text and project fonts, image transforms, page navigation, history and offline project storage are implemented. Catalog availability does not establish full visual or behavioral acceptance.

Save, Save As, automatic/manual named saving, New/Open/close and local recovery use the ordered background session. Retained working copies and destination archives are available through Recover work. Native checks cover automatic saving, manual Quit/restart recovery, Save As, missing-file close refusal, explicit recreation and immediate automatic-Quit flush. Shutdown cannot cancel an application exit after a save failure; recovery depends on durable local work. Filesystem stalls, final external-write races, path-alias limitations and archive cleanup UI remain unresolved. Forced-crash and power-loss acceptance are not established.

## Next work and unresolved acceptance

Keep the four integrated scenarios as repeatable acceptance fixtures. Keep the five-page table-based order variant alongside the original labels/fields version for integrated table acceptance. Continue control-specific palette/contrast, typography and constrained-wrapping comparisons while preserving distinct regular, bold, italic and bold-italic roles. Continue device geometry and remaining drawing style details against the established specification. Continue canvas/export and native interaction checks without treating catalog coverage as complete fidelity.

1. Broaden display-hardware acceptance for canvas pixel alignment; retain the demonstrated extra-filtering correction and distinguish remaining font/capture differences. Continue targeted shared-interaction investigation: native held library-drag cadence, display-pixel alignment and library autoscroll. Six screen points is the current onset threshold, not an exact timing acceptance result. Do not repeat completed preview foundations or claim native held verification from post-release captures.
2. Complete remaining group/component crop, lock and resize combinations, clipping, snapping and alignment behavior. Cropped-group ungrouping and group crop creation/adjustment/removal UI have scoped native acceptance; broader nested component combinations remain. Alternate versions, page hierarchy and presentation target/history behavior need broader acceptance.
3. Refine typography, state styling and geometric/visual edge cases against the established specification. Keep original artwork and fonts properly licensed. Legacy shape/rule coverage, image metadata and placeholder/filter behavior remain open where identified in family documents. Explicit stored Text Input heights remain fixed, while interactive insertion/resizing uses intrinsic auto height; reconcile that loading contract separately before any compatibility claim.
4. Complete PDF typography and remaining native failure/performance acceptance, image scale/options and broader font handling. Preserve shared canvas/export geometry.
5. Package and run native macOS, Windows and Linux acceptance and release checks. Large-document profiling, revision-based cache invalidation, forced failures and recovery remain outstanding. No full cross-platform or complete-fidelity claim.

Keep product-only fixtures/evidence local unless selected for distribution. Update this checkpoint and commit completed product work. No unattended supervision beyond active goal execution is implied. The overall goal remains active.
