# Wireframe — current state

## Goal and authority

Build a complete, usable offline Rust wireframing product for macOS, Windows and Linux, with close visual and behavioral fidelity to the established specification. The overall goal remains active. The initial investigation/readiness gate was met on 2026-10-13, and the user authorized automatic implementation progression. Continue targeted investigation when fidelity questions arise; do not treat a partial control inventory or passing foundation tests as product completion.

Work directly as Engineer. Preserve user files and explicit deferrals. Use synthetic fixtures for native experiments. Keep reference-specific names, extracted implementation/assets and investigation narratives outside this repository and its Git history. Original code is GPL-3.0-only from first commit 87f11c1; preserve dependency notices. Existing-format import remains deferred.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-15

Clean standalone and embedded scrollbars now use one drawing function across both axes. Fixed #515151 ink, opaque one-unit frame strips, capsule thumbs and axis-specific arrows remove discrepancies between control families. Disabled Clean parent fields retain the same scrollbar ink. Placement, document properties, history and Sketch drawing are unchanged. See docs/LINEAR-CONTROLS.md.

All 587 tests, all-target Clippy, formatting, repository-boundary and signed-bundle checks pass. Three new pixel regressions cover frame corners, arrow/capsule geometry, both axes, short tracks and standalone/embedded consistency including disabled fields. Seventeen native cases corroborate the behavior. Seven isolated Clean bar comparisons have mean RGB error below 1 on the 0–255 scale. Ten existing scenario PNGs, six documents and both Sketch comparison pages remain byte-identical. Native macOS checks cover both styles, 100% zoom, a value edit with one Undo, style Undo and byte-identical save. The signed debug build remains on the Clean fixture at 76% Fit. Full native Windows/Linux acceptance remains open.

The table border/scrollbar options and physical-pixel canvas-text alignment remain intact. Per-control placement/text differences, approximate Sketch contours, broader interaction and export acceptance remain open. No new PDFs are authored for this checkpoint.

Remaining scope includes selection-color customization, irregular outlines, glyph/device differences, held library-drag cadence, broader component combinations, PDF typography, native close-during-export, sustained responsiveness, failure/recovery and native Windows/Linux release acceptance. The overall goal remains active.

## Existing capabilities and limits

The 86-entry catalog, typed inspector, shared canvas/PNG/SVG rendering, recursive groups/components, rich text and project fonts, image transforms, page navigation, history and offline project storage are implemented. Catalog availability does not establish full visual or behavioral acceptance.

Save, Save As, automatic/manual named saving, New/Open/close and local recovery use the ordered background session. Retained working copies and destination archives are available through Recover work. Native checks cover automatic saving, manual Quit/restart recovery, Save As, missing-file close refusal, explicit recreation and immediate automatic-Quit flush. Shutdown cannot cancel an application exit after a save failure; recovery depends on durable local work. Filesystem stalls, final external-write races, path-alias limitations and archive cleanup UI remain unresolved. Forced-crash and power-loss acceptance are not established.

## Next work and unresolved acceptance

Keep the four integrated scenarios as repeatable acceptance fixtures. Keep the five-page table-based order variant alongside the original labels/fields version for integrated table acceptance. Continue control-specific palette/contrast, typography and constrained-wrapping comparisons while preserving distinct regular, bold, italic and bold-italic roles. Refine device geometry and drawing style details against the established specification. Continue canvas/export and native interaction checks without treating catalog coverage as complete fidelity.

1. Broaden display-hardware acceptance for canvas pixel alignment; retain the demonstrated extra-filtering correction and distinguish remaining font/capture differences. Continue targeted shared-interaction investigation: native held library-drag cadence, display-pixel alignment and library autoscroll. Six screen points is the current onset threshold, not an exact timing acceptance result. Do not repeat completed preview foundations or claim native held verification from post-release captures.
2. Complete remaining group/component crop, lock and resize combinations, clipping, snapping and alignment behavior. Cropped-group ungrouping and group crop creation/adjustment/removal UI have scoped native acceptance; broader nested component combinations remain. Alternate versions, page hierarchy and presentation target/history behavior need broader acceptance.
3. Refine typography, state styling and geometric/visual edge cases against the established specification. Keep original artwork and fonts properly licensed. Legacy shape/rule coverage, image metadata and placeholder/filter behavior remain open where identified in family documents.
4. Complete PDF typography and remaining native failure/performance acceptance, image scale/options and broader font handling. Preserve shared canvas/export geometry.
5. Package and run native macOS, Windows and Linux acceptance and release checks. Large-document profiling, revision-based cache invalidation, forced failures and recovery remain outstanding. No full cross-platform or complete-fidelity claim.

- docs/LIBRARY-INSERTION.md and docs/CANVAS-SCROLLING.md: pointer behavior and current verification limits.
- docs/SAVING.md, docs/PROJECT-SESSION.md, docs/WORKING-COPIES.md and docs/RECOVERY.md: desktop persistence and failure boundaries.
- docs/DOCUMENT-FORMAT.md and docs/RECURSIVE-EDITOR.md: recursive data and live editing/storage boundaries.
- docs/CATALOG-AND-LAYOUT.md and control-family documents: rendering and property requirements.
- docs/RICH-TEXT.md, docs/PROJECT-FONTS.md and docs/TEXT-ENTRY.md: text and fonts.

- docs/IMAGES.md and docs/COMPONENTS.md: image and component behavior and remaining gaps.

Keep product-only fixtures/evidence local unless selected for distribution. Update this checkpoint and commit completed product work. No unattended supervision beyond active goal execution is implied. The overall goal remains active.
