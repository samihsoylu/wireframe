# Wireframe — current state

## Goal and authority

Build a complete, usable offline Rust wireframing product for macOS, Windows and Linux, with close visual and behavioral fidelity to the established specification. The overall goal remains active. The initial investigation/readiness gate was met on 2026-10-13, and the user authorized automatic implementation progression. Continue targeted investigation when fidelity questions arise; do not treat a partial control inventory or passing foundation tests as product completion.

Work directly as Engineer. Preserve user files and explicit deferrals. Use synthetic fixtures for native experiments. Keep reference-specific names, extracted implementation/assets and investigation narratives outside this repository and its Git history. Original code is GPL-3.0-only from first commit 87f11c1; preserve dependency notices. Existing-format import remains deferred.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-16, contour refinement accepted

Original Sketch Button and rounded Rectangle profiles now use a stepped lower/right shadow and an extended curve through the stretchable regions. Solid ring triangulation chooses an interior diagonal after compression. Rounded fills use shared triangle geometry, correcting missing tiny fills and canvas seams. Rectangle options, text, palette, state colors and Clean geometry remain intact. See docs/OUTLINES.md.

All 18 target comparisons improve, including eight controls at previously unmeasured sizes. The other 50 style/size crops remain identical. Across 20 realistic scenario/options images, twelve are identical and the other eight change only inside affected controls. Six source documents remain unchanged. Four PDF pages were visually inspected and retain searchable text; state/opacity and local component override probes pass.

All 601 tests across 133 targets pass in one complete run after the final runtime correction. Clippy, formatting, signed packaging, exclusion boundary, first-commit GPL and unchanged dependencies/fonts pass. A canvas tessellation regression test covers 135 interior points at five sizes and three zooms. Native button resize/Undo/Redo, rounded resize/Undo, opacity/Undo, style/Undo and process restart/reopen pass; each Undo and the final reopen restore exact original bytes. The running macOS app shows the mutable Sketch size fixture at 72% Fit, 60 controls, 0 selected, Saved. Self-review only; native Windows/Linux remains unverified.

Earlier 8×8 comparison fixtures accidentally used an interactive resize helper and became 10×10. Those twelve tiny comparisons were invalid. Corrected fixtures assign exact dimensions; Text Input uses automatic height for its intrinsic interactive sizing. Explicit fixed Input heights remain a separate unresolved loading contract. Exact outline ink/curvature, broader typography, held library-drag cadence, failure/performance and native Windows/Linux acceptance remain open. The overall goal remains active.

## Existing capabilities and limits

The 86-entry catalog, typed inspector, shared canvas/PNG/SVG rendering, recursive groups/components, rich text and project fonts, image transforms, page navigation, history and offline project storage are implemented. Catalog availability does not establish full visual or behavioral acceptance.

Save, Save As, automatic/manual named saving, New/Open/close and local recovery use the ordered background session. Retained working copies and destination archives are available through Recover work. Native checks cover automatic saving, manual Quit/restart recovery, Save As, missing-file close refusal, explicit recreation and immediate automatic-Quit flush. Shutdown cannot cancel an application exit after a save failure; recovery depends on durable local work. Filesystem stalls, final external-write races, path-alias limitations and archive cleanup UI remain unresolved. Forced-crash and power-loss acceptance are not established.

## Next work and unresolved acceptance

Keep the four integrated scenarios as repeatable acceptance fixtures. Keep the five-page table-based order variant alongside the original labels/fields version for integrated table acceptance. Continue control-specific palette/contrast, typography and constrained-wrapping comparisons while preserving distinct regular, bold, italic and bold-italic roles. Continue device geometry and remaining drawing style details against the established specification. Continue canvas/export and native interaction checks without treating catalog coverage as complete fidelity.

1. Broaden display-hardware acceptance for canvas pixel alignment; retain the demonstrated extra-filtering correction and distinguish remaining font/capture differences. Continue targeted shared-interaction investigation: native held library-drag cadence, display-pixel alignment and library autoscroll. Six screen points is the current onset threshold, not an exact timing acceptance result. Do not repeat completed preview foundations or claim native held verification from post-release captures.
2. Complete remaining group/component crop, lock and resize combinations, clipping, snapping and alignment behavior. Cropped-group ungrouping and group crop creation/adjustment/removal UI have scoped native acceptance; broader nested component combinations remain. Alternate versions, page hierarchy and presentation target/history behavior need broader acceptance.
3. Refine typography, state styling and geometric/visual edge cases against the established specification. Keep original artwork and fonts properly licensed. Legacy shape/rule coverage, image metadata and placeholder/filter behavior remain open where identified in family documents. Explicit stored Text Input heights remain fixed, while interactive insertion/resizing uses intrinsic auto height; reconcile that loading contract separately before any compatibility claim.
4. Complete PDF typography and remaining native failure/performance acceptance, image scale/options and broader font handling. Preserve shared canvas/export geometry.
5. Package and run native macOS, Windows and Linux acceptance and release checks. Large-document profiling, revision-based cache invalidation, forced failures and recovery remain outstanding. No full cross-platform or complete-fidelity claim.

Keep product-only fixtures/evidence local unless selected for distribution. Update this checkpoint and commit completed product work. No unattended supervision beyond active goal execution is implied. The overall goal remains active.
