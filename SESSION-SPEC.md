# Wireframe — current state

## Goal and authority

Build a complete, usable offline Rust wireframing product for macOS, Windows and Linux, with close visual and behavioral fidelity to the established specification. The overall goal remains active. The initial investigation/readiness gate was met on 2026-10-13, and the user authorized automatic implementation progression. Continue targeted investigation when fidelity questions arise; do not treat a partial control inventory or passing foundation tests as product completion.

Work directly as Engineer. Preserve user files and explicit deferrals. Use synthetic fixtures for native experiments. Keep reference-specific names, extracted implementation/assets and investigation narratives outside this repository and its Git history. Original code is GPL-3.0-only from first commit 87f11c1; preserve dependency notices. Existing-format import remains deferred.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-15

Stable vector outlines now serve Sketch Button, Text Input and Text Area. Rectangle has Square, Rounded, Dashed and No border choices, custom border color and independent fill opacity in its typed inspector. Corner regions retain their size on ordinary resize and compress for tiny frames. Stored rectangle captions remain editable. See docs/OUTLINES.md.

Functional validation covers the 60-case size/style matrix, 48-control state/opacity fixtures in each style, three component instances on two pages, exact history/storage and four visually inspected PDF pages with searchable text. Across 20 integrated scenario/options images, all ten Clean images and two unaffected Sketch images remain identical; the other eight change only inside affected controls. Six original documents remain byte-identical.

Native macOS acceptance covers border choices, opacity, RGB editing, width edit/Undo, style switching, Save and process restart/reopen. Undo restores exact original project bytes; resize Undo and final reopen also preserve exact bytes. The signed debug build is open on the saved Clean outline fixture at 72% Fit with 60 controls and one selected Rectangle. Native Windows/Linux remains unverified.

All 599 tests across 133 unique targets pass. The all-target run was resumed after correcting one antialiasing-sensitive test assertion; earlier passing targets were retained and every remaining target completed. Clippy, formatting, signed-bundle verification, unchanged dependencies/fonts, first-commit GPL and repository-boundary checks pass. This accepts the functional checkpoint, with the visual discrepancies below still open.

Exact outline fidelity remains open. The Sketch Button pixel comparison is worse than the former straight outline at all five measured sizes, despite stable corners; its ink distribution is the next targeted investigation. Rounded Sketch Rectangle curvature also remains approximate. Functional coverage does not close these visual discrepancies. The accepted palette, table geometry/options, shared scrollbar and physical-pixel text alignment remain intact.

## Existing capabilities and limits

The 86-entry catalog, typed inspector, shared canvas/PNG/SVG rendering, recursive groups/components, rich text and project fonts, image transforms, page navigation, history and offline project storage are implemented. Catalog availability does not establish full visual or behavioral acceptance.

Save, Save As, automatic/manual named saving, New/Open/close and local recovery use the ordered background session. Retained working copies and destination archives are available through Recover work. Native checks cover automatic saving, manual Quit/restart recovery, Save As, missing-file close refusal, explicit recreation and immediate automatic-Quit flush. Shutdown cannot cancel an application exit after a save failure; recovery depends on durable local work. Filesystem stalls, final external-write races, path-alias limitations and archive cleanup UI remain unresolved. Forced-crash and power-loss acceptance are not established.

## Next work and unresolved acceptance

Keep the four integrated scenarios as repeatable acceptance fixtures. Keep the five-page table-based order variant alongside the original labels/fields version for integrated table acceptance. Continue control-specific palette/contrast, typography and constrained-wrapping comparisons while preserving distinct regular, bold, italic and bold-italic roles. Investigate Sketch Button ink distribution and rounded Rectangle curvature next, then continue device geometry and drawing style details against the established specification. Continue canvas/export and native interaction checks without treating catalog coverage as complete fidelity.

1. Broaden display-hardware acceptance for canvas pixel alignment; retain the demonstrated extra-filtering correction and distinguish remaining font/capture differences. Continue targeted shared-interaction investigation: native held library-drag cadence, display-pixel alignment and library autoscroll. Six screen points is the current onset threshold, not an exact timing acceptance result. Do not repeat completed preview foundations or claim native held verification from post-release captures.
2. Complete remaining group/component crop, lock and resize combinations, clipping, snapping and alignment behavior. Cropped-group ungrouping and group crop creation/adjustment/removal UI have scoped native acceptance; broader nested component combinations remain. Alternate versions, page hierarchy and presentation target/history behavior need broader acceptance.
3. Refine typography, state styling and geometric/visual edge cases against the established specification. Keep original artwork and fonts properly licensed. Legacy shape/rule coverage, image metadata and placeholder/filter behavior remain open where identified in family documents.
4. Complete PDF typography and remaining native failure/performance acceptance, image scale/options and broader font handling. Preserve shared canvas/export geometry.
5. Package and run native macOS, Windows and Linux acceptance and release checks. Large-document profiling, revision-based cache invalidation, forced failures and recovery remain outstanding. No full cross-platform or complete-fidelity claim.

Keep product-only fixtures/evidence local unless selected for distribution. Update this checkpoint and commit completed product work. No unattended supervision beyond active goal execution is implied. The overall goal remains active.
