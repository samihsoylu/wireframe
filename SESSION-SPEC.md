# Wireframe — current state

## Goal and authority

Build a complete, usable offline Rust wireframing product for macOS, Windows and Linux, with close visual and behavioral fidelity to the established specification. The overall goal remains active. The initial investigation/readiness gate was met on 2026-10-13, and the user authorized automatic implementation progression. Continue targeted investigation when fidelity questions arise; do not treat a partial control inventory or passing foundation tests as product completion.

Work directly as Engineer. Preserve user files and explicit deferrals. Use synthetic fixtures for native experiments. Keep reference-specific names, extracted implementation/assets and investigation narratives outside this repository and its Git history. Original code is GPL-3.0-only from first commit 87f11c1; preserve dependency notices. Existing-format import remains deferred.

## Current checkpoint — Linux desktop and debug package

The integrated portable text build runs from an extracted debug archive on Debian 12 aarch64, X11/Openbox and Mesa llvmpipe. Packaging now respects Cargo’s configured target directory. Runtime installation needed libxkbcommon-x11-0 in addition to the desktop portal and graphics support; see docs/PACKAGING.md.

The four-page sample renders. Held library insertion shows a moving preview without changing the saved document until release. Insertion, paced editing, undo/redo, page switching, portal Save As, normal close and reopen have scoped Linux acceptance. Rapid typing followed immediately by a focus change demonstrably drops trailing characters. Investigate and fix this input defect next; also check Save snapshot ordering against pending field input. No general input reliability or release readiness claim.

The previous positioned-text integration retains its macOS/Linux tests and unchanged sampled macOS scenario exports. The installed macOS app remains unchanged. Windows, physical GPU/Wayland and release-package checks remain open. Native optical-size adjustment differs from the portable default-axis behavior; broad font parity and PDF reader extraction remain open. Preserve accepted device artwork, canvas alignment and embedded fonts. General canvas softness, held drag cadence, failure/performance and the broader release requirements remain unresolved. Engineer self-review only; the full goal remains active.

## Existing capabilities and limits

The 86-entry catalog, typed inspector, shared canvas/PNG/SVG rendering, recursive groups/components, rich text and project fonts, image transforms, page navigation, history and offline project storage are implemented. Catalog availability does not establish full visual or behavioral acceptance.

Save, Save As, automatic/manual named saving, New/Open/close and local recovery use the ordered background session. Retained working copies and destination archives are available through Recover work. Native checks cover automatic saving, manual Quit/restart recovery, Save As, missing-file close refusal, explicit recreation and immediate automatic-Quit flush. Shutdown cannot cancel an application exit after a save failure; recovery depends on durable local work. Filesystem stalls, final external-write races, path-alias limitations and archive cleanup UI remain unresolved. Forced-crash and power-loss acceptance are not established.

## Next work and unresolved acceptance

Keep the four integrated scenarios as repeatable acceptance fixtures. Keep the five-page table-based order variant alongside the original labels/fields version for integrated table acceptance. Continue control-specific palette/contrast, typography and constrained-wrapping comparisons while preserving distinct regular, bold, italic and bold-italic roles. Continue device geometry and remaining drawing style details against the established specification. Continue canvas/export and native interaction checks without treating catalog coverage as complete fidelity.

1. Broaden display-hardware acceptance for canvas pixel alignment; retain the demonstrated extra-filtering correction and distinguish remaining font/capture differences. Continue targeted shared-interaction investigation: native held library-drag cadence, display-pixel alignment and library autoscroll. Six screen points is the current onset threshold, not an exact timing acceptance result. Linux sampled held preview is verified; retain macOS/reference cadence and broader hardware gaps. Do not infer held verification from post-release captures.
2. Complete remaining group/component crop, lock and resize combinations, clipping, snapping and alignment behavior. Cropped-group ungrouping and group crop creation/adjustment/removal UI have scoped native acceptance; broader nested component combinations remain. Alternate versions, page hierarchy and presentation target/history behavior need broader acceptance.
3. Refine typography, state styling and geometric/visual edge cases against the established specification. Keep original artwork and fonts properly licensed. Legacy shape/rule coverage, image metadata and placeholder/filter behavior remain open where identified in family documents. Explicit stored Text Input heights remain fixed, while interactive insertion/resizing uses intrinsic auto height; reconcile that loading contract separately before any compatibility claim.
4. Complete PDF typography and remaining native failure/performance acceptance, image scale/options and broader font handling. Preserve shared canvas/export geometry.
5. Package and run native macOS, Windows and Linux acceptance and release checks. Large-document profiling, revision-based cache invalidation, forced failures and recovery remain outstanding. No full cross-platform or complete-fidelity claim.

Keep product-only fixtures/evidence local unless selected for distribution. Update this checkpoint and commit completed product work. No unattended supervision beyond active goal execution is implied. The overall goal remains active.
