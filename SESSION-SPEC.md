# Wireframe — current state

## Goal and authority

Build a complete, usable offline Rust wireframing product for macOS, Windows and Linux, with close visual and behavioral fidelity to the established specification. The overall goal remains active. The initial investigation/readiness gate was met on 2026-10-13, and the user authorized automatic implementation progression. Continue targeted investigation when fidelity questions arise; do not treat a partial control inventory or passing foundation tests as product completion.

Work directly as Engineer. Preserve user files and explicit deferrals. Use synthetic fixtures for native experiments. Keep reference-specific names, extracted implementation/assets and investigation narratives outside this repository and its Git history. Original code is GPL-3.0-only from first commit 87f11c1; preserve dependency notices. Existing-format import remains deferred.

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-15

Notched phone frames now have rounded shoulders, short vertical necks and rounded lower corners in both styles. Original analytic geometry uses the existing fit/stretch and orientation transforms; transparent screen openings and the continuous frame mesh remain intact. See docs/PHONE-LAYOUT.md.

The four integrated scenarios retain 48 controls and five page links. Both project files and all six non-phone PNG outputs remain byte-identical to the preceding checkpoint. Two four-page PDFs retain five internal links each; all eight rendered pages were inspected. A raster regression verifies the notch neck, opening and solid body over underlying artwork in both orientations, sizing modes and styles. Existing small/extreme dimensions and other phone behaviors still pass.

All 570 tests, all-target Clippy and formatting pass. Native macOS inspection covers both styles in the phone contact scenario; Undo and Save restore the exact original project bytes. The signed debug bundle is running, UUID 33044FA1-9A68-3214-B867-3C3BC0383C5D, with Clean phone contact at 82%, no selection. No build/test jobs remain. Self-review only. Exact frame/detail weights, typography and other geometry differences remain; the overall goal is active.

The previous PDF export checkpoint remains accepted: background immutable snapshots, atomic output, page/alternate selection, paper sizing, decoration, cancellation retention, Preview navigation and preserving an existing destination on failure. Remaining PDF typography, native close-during-export and sustained responsiveness checks are still open. Native Windows/Linux and full release acceptance are not established.

## Existing capabilities and limits

The 86-entry catalog, typed inspector, shared canvas/PNG/SVG rendering, recursive groups/components, rich text and project fonts, image transforms, page navigation, history and offline project storage are implemented. Catalog availability does not establish full visual or behavioral acceptance.

Save, Save As, automatic/manual named saving, New/Open/close and local recovery use the ordered background session. Retained working copies and destination archives are available through Recover work. Native checks cover automatic saving, manual Quit/restart recovery, Save As, missing-file close refusal, explicit recreation and immediate automatic-Quit flush. Shutdown cannot cancel an application exit after a save failure; recovery depends on durable local work. Filesystem stalls, final external-write races, path-alias limitations and archive cleanup UI remain unresolved. Forced-crash and power-loss acceptance are not established.

## Next work and unresolved acceptance

Keep the four integrated scenarios as repeatable acceptance fixtures. Prioritize typography and constrained wrapping while preserving distinct regular, bold, italic and bold-italic roles. Refine device geometry and drawing style details against the established specification. Continue canvas/export and native interaction checks without treating catalog coverage as complete fidelity.

1. Continue targeted shared-interaction investigation: native held library-drag cadence, display-pixel alignment and library autoscroll. Six screen points is the current onset threshold, not an exact timing acceptance result. Do not repeat completed preview foundations or claim native held verification from post-release captures.
2. Complete remaining group/component crop, lock and resize combinations, clipping, snapping and alignment behavior. Cropped-group ungrouping and group crop creation/adjustment/removal UI have scoped native acceptance; broader nested component combinations remain. Alternate versions, page hierarchy and presentation target/history behavior need broader acceptance.
3. Refine typography, state styling and geometric/visual edge cases against the established specification. Keep original artwork and fonts properly licensed. Legacy shape/rule coverage, image metadata and placeholder/filter behavior remain open where identified in family documents.
4. Complete PDF typography and remaining native failure/performance acceptance, image scale/options and broader font handling. Preserve shared canvas/export geometry.
5. Package and run native macOS, Windows and Linux acceptance and release checks. Large-document profiling, revision-based cache invalidation, forced failures and recovery remain outstanding. No full cross-platform or complete-fidelity claim.

## Durable specifications

- docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md: full scope and acceptance discipline.
- docs/LIBRARY-INSERTION.md and docs/CANVAS-SCROLLING.md: pointer behavior and current verification limits.
- docs/SAVING.md, docs/PROJECT-SESSION.md, docs/WORKING-COPIES.md and docs/RECOVERY.md: desktop persistence and failure boundaries.
- docs/DOCUMENT-FORMAT.md and docs/RECURSIVE-EDITOR.md: recursive data and live editing/storage boundaries.
- docs/CATALOG-AND-LAYOUT.md and control-family documents: rendering and property requirements.
- docs/RICH-TEXT.md, docs/PROJECT-FONTS.md and docs/TEXT-ENTRY.md: text and fonts.
- docs/PDF-EXPORT.md: page selection, sizing, notes, text/link fidelity, architecture boundaries and scoped integrated acceptance.
- docs/IMAGES.md and docs/COMPONENTS.md: image and component behavior and remaining gaps.

Keep product-only fixtures/evidence local unless selected for distribution. Update this checkpoint and commit completed product work. No unattended supervision beyond active goal execution is implied. The overall goal remains active.
